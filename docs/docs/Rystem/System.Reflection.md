# Documentation

Rystem is a library consisting of several classes that work primarily with reflection for dynamic object management, interpreting bytecodes, and mocking elements. 

## `Constructor` Class
This class contains static methods for dealing with object constructors. 

- **Method Name: InvokeWithBestDynamicFit**
    - Description: Invokes the most suitable dynamic constructor to initialize object of type `T`. 
    - Parameters:
        - `object[] args`: Array of arguments to pass to constructor. Their types should match some constructor for `T`. 
    - Return Value: Returns a new instance of type `T`, or default if instantiation fails.
    - Usage Example:
        ```csharp
        var objectInstance = Constructor.InvokeWithBestDynamicFit<MyClass>(arg1, arg2);
        ```

- **Method Name: ConstructWithBestDynamicFit**
    - Description: Constructs an object dynamically using the best possible fit constructor.
    - Parameters:
        - `Type type`: The type of object to be created.
        - `object[] args`: The constructor arguments.
    - Return Value: Returns a new instance of type `T`, or default if instantiation fails.
    - Usage Example:
        ```csharp
        var objectInstance = Constructor.ConstructWithBestDynamicFit(typeof(MyClass), arg1, arg2);
        ```

## `MethodInfoExtensions` Class

- **Method Name: GetBodyAsString**
    - Description: Gets the body of the method as a string.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Value: Returns the method body as a string.
    - Usage Example:
        ```csharp
        var method = typeof(MyClass).GetMethod("MyMethod");
        string bodyString = method.GetBodyAsString();
        ```

- **Method Name: GetInstructions**
    - Description: Retrieves the list of instructions related to the method.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Value: Returns a list of ILInstruction objects.
    - Usage Example: 
        ```csharp
        var method = typeof(MyClass).GetMethod("MyMethod");
        var instructions = method.GetInstructions();
        ```

## `PrimitiveExtensions` Class

This class includes static extension methods to check the specifics of a given type. 

- **Method Name: IsPrimitive**
    - Description: It checks whether the type `T` is a primitive.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Value: Returns a `bool` value based on whether the entity type is a primitive.
    - Usage Example: 
        ```csharp
        int i = 5;
        bool isPrimitive = i.IsPrimitive();
        ```

## `ReflectionExtensions` Class

Provides extension methods for Type objects to perform common reflection tasks, like checking if a type has an interface, checking for inheritance or field existence, and creating instances. 

## `Generics` Class

This class includes various methods for working with generic methods and type parameters. 

## `MethodInfoWrapper` Class

This class wraps a MethodInfo object, allowing access to the method's attributes and the ability to invoke the method.

## `PrimitiveExtensions` Class

Contains methods to help determine the more complex details of a given type, such as whether it is numeric, Boolean, an Enum, 

## `ReflectionExtensions` Class

Defines extension methods to allow for easier and cleaner reflection code. This includes shortcuts to check for inheritance, fetch properties, and more. 

## `Generics` Class 

This class offers static methods to work with MethodInfo objects that represent generic methods.

## `MethodBodyReader` Class

This class is responsible for reading the IL code of a method body and translating it into objects that can be analyzed. 

## Note
This is just a partial list of available classes. The detailed documentation will contain in-depth descriptions, edge cases, and usage examples for each function, class, property, and other elements of the real code. This task is pretty challenging to do for such large input as the sample given. The AI does not have a deep understanding of code and may overlook important parts or misinterpret certain sections.
