# ContentRepositoryBuilderExtensions Class

This class belongs to the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection namespace and serves as an extension for the ContentRepositoryBuilder. It allows developers to add an "In Memory" repository configuration to the content repository.

### WithInMemoryIntegration method

**Method Description**:

This method adds an "In Memory" integration to the content repository. This integration can be used to store data in the application's memory space, useful for testing or rapid data access scenarios not requiring permanent storage.

**Parameters**:

- `IContentRepositoryBuilder builder`: This parameter is the instance of an `IContentRepositoryBuilder` to which we want to add the in-memory integration.
- `string? name(optional)`: This is an optional parameter that represents the name of the in-memory integration. If not specified, a default name will be used.

**Return Value**:

Returns the builder instance (`IContentRepositoryBuilder`), allowing for continued building operations.

**Usage Example**:

```csharp
services
    .AddContentRepository()
    .WithInMemoryIntegration("inMemorySample");
```

# Test Sample Usage
The `WithInMemoryIntegration` was used in the services configuration method (`ConfigureServices`) within the `Startup` class inside the `File.UnitTest` namespace:

```csharp
services
    .AddContentRepository()
    .WithInMemoryIntegration("inmemory");
```

This implies that an in-memory content repository named "inmemory" is added to the services during the application startup. It could be further used in other parts of the application to perform actions on in-memory data storage.

The `WithInMemoryIntegration` is also used in integration tests under the `AllStorageTest` class inside the `File.UnitTest` namespace, for example in the `ExecuteAsync` method:

```csharp
var contentRepository = _contentRepositoryFactory.Create("inMemorySample");
```

This example shows the repository with name "inMemorySample" being retrieved and used in the testing processes, indicating its usage for performing various operations like file upload, delete, checking if file exist, overriding etc., in an in-memory storage of given repository.

## Note:
While using "In Memory" integration, keep in mind that data will not persist through different runs of the application since the data is not written to a permanent storage system. This integration is mainly helpful for use cases that involve temporary data storage, such as unit testing.
