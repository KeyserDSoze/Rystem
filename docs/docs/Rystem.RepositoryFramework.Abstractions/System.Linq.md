# QueryPatternExtensions Class Documentation

This class extends the functionality of the `IQueryPattern` interface, providing a collection of utility methods to perform common querying operations on repositories. 

## Method Details

---

### QueryAsync()

**Description**: This method is used to fetch all elements from a repository.

**Parameters**:

`entity`: This is an instance of `IQueryPattern` that represents your repository.

`cancellationToken`: This optional parameter is used to optionally cancel the operation.

**Return Value**: This method returns an `IAsyncEnumerable` object that contains all elements of your repository.

**Usage Example**:

```csharp
// Assuming repository implements IQueryPattern interface
var allElements = repository.QueryAsync();
```

---

### ToListAsEntityAsync()

**Description**: This method is used to fetch all elements from a repository and return them as a list.

**Parameters**:

`entity`: This is an instance of `IQueryPattern` that represents your repository.

`cancellationToken`: This optional parameter is used to optionally cancel the operation.

**Return Value**: This method returns a `ValueTask` that results in a `List` of all elements in your repository.

**Usage Example**:

```csharp
// Assuming repository implements IQueryPattern interface
var allElementsList = await repository.ToListAsEntityAsync();
```

---

### QueryAsEntityAsync()

**Description**: This method is used to fetch all elements from a repository and return them as `IAsyncEnumerable`.

**Parameters**:

`entity`: This is an instance of `IQueryPattern` that represents your repository.

`cancellationToken`: This optional parameter is used to optionally cancel the operation.

**Return Value**: This method returns an `IAsyncEnumerable` object that contains all elements of your repository.

**Usage Example**:

```csharp
// Assuming repository implements IQueryPattern interface
var asyncElements = repository.QueryAsEntityAsync();
```

---

### AsQueryBuilder()

**Description**: This method is used to create a `QueryBuilder` instance for your repository which can then be used to build complex queries.

**Parameters**:

`entity`: This is an instance of `IQueryPattern` that represents your repository.

**Return Value**: This method returns a `QueryBuilder` instance for the specified repository.

**Usage Example**:

```csharp
// Assuming repository implements IQueryPattern interface
var queryBuilder = repository.AsQueryBuilder();
```

---

For the remaining methods, see the following pattern:

`Where()`, `Take()`, `Skip()`, `OrderBy()`, and `OrderByDescending()` are used to construct advanced queries.

`GroupByAsync()`, `AnyAsync()`, `FirstOrDefaultAsync()`, `FirstAsync()`, `PageAsync()`, `SumAsync()`, `AverageAsync()`, `MaxAsync()`, `MinAsync()`, and `ToListAsync()` fetch data from the repository based on the query parameters, ranging from counting the total elements to performing aggregate operations like sums and averages.

The parameters include the repository entity, an expression representing the query or property to operate on, the number of elements to take or skip, the cancellation token, etc., depending on the method.

The methods return an asynchronous task-based result containing the fetched or computed data, which could be a simple boolean, a single element, a list of elements, a count, or an aggregate value.

Use them as follows:

```csharp
// Assuming repository implements IQueryPattern interface
var selectedElements = await repository.Where(x => x.Property > 100).ToListAsync();
var totalElements = await repository.CountAsync();
var sumOfElementsProperty = await repository.SumAsync(x => x.Property);
```
The above example filters elements based on a property, counts total elements, and calculates a sum.
In this way, these methods can be combined to create powerful and flexible queries for data retrieval.
