# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Pattern

> Implement Domain-Driven Design patterns with Rystem Repository Framework

## Description

This tool provides guidance for implementing DDD patterns using Rystem, including entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain services.

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Objects with a unique identity that persists over time.

```csharp
public class Order : IEntity<Guid>
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; } = new();
}
```

### Value Objects
Objects without identity, defined by their attributes.

```csharp
public record Address(string Street, string City, string ZipCode, string Country);
```

### Aggregates
Cluster of entities and value objects with a root entity.

```csharp
public class OrderAggregate : IEntity<Guid>
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public Customer Customer { get; set; }
    public Address ShippingAddress { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; private set; } = new();

    public void AddItem(Product product, int quantity)
    {
        // Domain logic here
        Items.Add(new OrderItem(product, quantity));
    }
}
```

### Repository Pattern
Provides abstraction over data access.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRepository<OrderAggregate, Guid>(repositoryBuilder =>
{
    repositoryBuilder.WithEntityFramework<ApplicationDbContext>();
});

// Usage
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IRepository<OrderAggregate, Guid> _orderRepository;

    public async Task<OrderAggregate> CreateOrder(CreateOrderCommand command)
    {
        var order = new OrderAggregate { /* ... */ };
        await _orderRepository.InsertAsync(order);
        return order;
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep aggregates small** - Only include entities that must change together
2. **Use value objects** - For concepts without identity
3. **Domain logic in entities** - Business rules belong in the domain model
4. **Repository per aggregate** - One repository for each aggregate root
5. **Use domain events** - For communication between aggregates

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Define Your Domain Model
Start by identifying entities, value objects, and aggregates.

### 2. Setup Repositories
Configure repositories for each aggregate root.

### 3. Implement Domain Services
For logic that doesn't belong to a single entity.

### 4. Add Application Services
Orchestrate domain operations and handle transactions.
